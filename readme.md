This app was built using react, react-form and the chakra-ui library to expedite the component development process. The VideoList and VideoDetail components were created using the useFetch hook to fetch data from the YouTube API. The NewVideo component was created using the useForm hook to create a form that can be submitted to the YouTube API.

The app can be installed and run locally by running `npm install` and `npm start`.
